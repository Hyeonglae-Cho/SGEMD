# Statistical Graph Empirical Mode Decomposition by Graph Denoising and Boundary Treatment

We provide the R codes and data that can reproduce the results presented in the paper 'Statistical Graph Empirical Mode Decomposition by Graph Denoising and Boundary Treatment'.

- R_code: All the codes necessary for regenerating the numerical and graphical results presented in the paper are provided.
  - 'SGEMD_functions.R': Functions essential for graph signal decomposition methods (graph empirical mode decomposition, statistical graph empirical mode decomposition, graph Fourier decomposition).
  - 'Visualization_functions.R': Functions to visualize the graph signal.
  - 'Irregular_simulation.R', 'Lattice_simulation.R', and 'Outliers_simulation.R': R codes to reproduce the numerical results (results of simulations studies) presented in the paper.
  - 'Irregular_visualizations.R', 'Lattice_visualizations.R', and 'Outliers_visualizations.R': R codes to reproduce the graphical results presented in the paper.
  - 'RealData_SeoulMetor.R': R codes to reproduce the results for real data presented in the paper.
  - 'Visualization_GraphDenoising.R': R codes to reproduce the graphical results for empirical Bayes thresholding and graph denoising presented in the paper.
 
- Data_SeoulMetro: All the real data used in the paper are provided.
